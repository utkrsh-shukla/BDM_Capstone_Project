Once upon a time in the land of Kanpur, a data warrior (yours truly) took on the quest: optimizing FMCG distribution for R.L. Associates. With Python as my sword and messy datasets as my dragons, I ventured through three treacherous stages—Proposal, Midterm, and Final. Here's how it all went down:



🛠 𝗦𝘁𝗮𝗴𝗲 𝟭: 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗽𝗼𝘀𝗮𝗹


Our journey began with a simple meeting in Mr. Trivedi's office. Armed with Excel sheets and his infinite patience, he revealed the realm's problems:

• No near-expiry tracking (items were vanishing like ice cream from my fridge)

• Disorganized inventory (like apps in my homescreen)

• Unpredictable sales trends (every month was a surprise party, but without the cake)


With clarity (and coffee) in hand, I pledged to bring order to the chaos. 🤺

Ah, the experimental phase—the part where every hero questions their life choices.


• I summoned Prophet, a forecasting tool as promising as its name. It worked… sort of. Turns out, it wasn't a fan of messy, seasonal data

• I turned to K-means clustering to tame the wild "distributors data"

• But the real plot twist? Outliers like banks and high-value transactions. Why was a bank buying FMCG goods? Was it hoarding snacks? Mysteries abounded



📈 𝗦𝘁𝗮𝗴𝗲 𝟯: 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗙𝗶𝗻𝗮𝗹 𝗦𝗵𝗼𝘄𝗱𝗼𝘄𝗻


With lessons learned, I leveled up. Enter SARIMA, the forecasting champion. It tamed the chaos, helping me forecast sales trends like a seasoned seer.


𝗛𝗲𝗿𝗲'𝘀 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗜 𝗯𝘂𝗶𝗹𝘁:


• Early Warning System: Flagging at-risk products before they became zombies

• ABC Analysis: Sorting inventory into A, B, and C classes (because even stock needs a seating chart)

• Distributor Segmentation: Prioritized relationships with premium partners and provided growth strategies for smaller players

• Sales Forecasting: Trends became predictable, and R.L. Associates finally knew when to stock up or slow down


Now that the quest is over, the kingdom of R.L. Associates is thriving with smarter inventory management and better distributor relationships.
